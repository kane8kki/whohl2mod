the player is stuck in a loop
and he want to know why he is here
and step by step, he realise that he is not alive
got said to him : you want to know why you are here ?
you are not even alive, you are here to undersand the pain you infiged to others
you need to feel it and to understand that making the bad is not right
i gave you a planet, and the ability to dominate it, 
and what you did to it is to violate it and to make pain to people inferior to you
you can hate me, and pray in satan or any kind of other gods, but you will again pray for me
because i created everything, even the concept of myself
maybe what you experience right now is just nothing, not just a silent black place
but nothing because, the black color and concept of silence was created by me
just nothing.
but why are you experiencing something after death ?
because...
i fooled you, you are not even diying.
